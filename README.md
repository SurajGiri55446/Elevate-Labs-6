# Java ToDo List Manager

A desktop-based task management application built using **Java Swing**. This application allows users to add, delete, and clear tasks through a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Tasks are displayed in a scrollable list, and all actions are performed in real-time without requiring a restart.

This project showcases the use of **Java Swing** for GUI development, event handling, and the `DefaultListModel` for dynamic task management.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The **Java ToDo List Manager** is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Key features include:

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks via a text field and add them to the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can select and remove individual tasks from the list.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Users can clear the entire task list with a single action.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The task list updates instantly without needing to restart the application.
- **Scrollable Task List**: Tasks are displayed in a scrollable `JList` for easy viewing.

The project demonstrates core Java concepts, including GUI development with **Java Swing**, event-driven programming, and dynamic data management using `DefaultListModel`.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 24**: For writing, compiling, and executing Java code.
- **Java Swing**: Built-in Java library for creating the graphical user interface.
- **IDE**: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse for development.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and project hosting.
